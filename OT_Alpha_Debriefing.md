# Debriefing
This research project is built on previous work from our lab that have found reliable and
valid measures of individual differences in visual object recognition. Typically, individual
differences research is focused on higher cognitive abilities or personality, but individual
differences in high-level perceptual-cognitive processes can hint towards mechanisms
and how different perceptual processes relate to each other. A natural extension to
previous work in individual differences in visual object recognition is to the sense of
touch. Visual tasks can be reasonably extended into the tactile modality with relatively
little changes to the overall procedures. However, in order to study individual
differences, proper measurements need to be developed. We are currently collecting
data to test the tactile versions of the individual differences tasks from previous visual
work. We will use this data to iterate on the tasks to improve their reliability in measuring
variability in performances between participants.

Individual differences research flips the typical psychological research paradigm where
the variability between participants is typically minimized or controlled for. Instead, we
will look towards maximize our ability to measure differences between participants. In
our case, the dependent variables are the measures of scale reliability while the trials
themselves are the independent variables.

Once we can be confident that our measures of variability in tactile object recognition
performance are reliable and valid, we can begin exploring whether or not individual
differences is consistent across different types of tasks. Furthermore, we could compare
individual differences across domains of perception and potentially localize them in the
brain. The study you participated in is just the first step in a wider series of studies to
understand individual differences in object recognition.
